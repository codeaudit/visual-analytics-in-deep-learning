### Web analytics and search engines

You can measure visits to your website either by using [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) tracking embed or the more advanced [Google Tag Manager](https://www.google.com/analytics/tag-manager/) container.
* For Google Analytics set up the value for `google_analytics`, it should be something like `google_analytics: UA-XXXXXXXX-X`.
* For Google Tag Manager set up the value for `google_tag_manager`, it should be something like: `google_tag_manager: GTM-XXXXX`.
* _Do not_ set both of above methods because this will cause conflicts and skew your reporting data.
* Remember that you need to properly configure the GTM container in its admin panel if you want it to work. More info is available in [GTM's docs](https://www.google.com/analytics/tag-manager/resources/).
